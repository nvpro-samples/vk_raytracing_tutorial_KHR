The focus of this document and the provided code is to showcase a basic integration of
ray tracing within an existing Vulkan sample, using the
[`VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline)
extension. This tutorial starts from a basic Vulkan application and provides step-by-step instructions to modify and add
methods and functions. The sections are organized by components, with subsections identifying the modified functions.

# Introduction
<script type="preformatted">
This tutorial highlights the steps to add ray tracing to an existing Vulkan application, and assumes a working knowledge
of Vulkan in general. The code verbosity of classical components such as swapchain management, render passes etc. is
reduced using [C++ API helpers](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nvpro_core/tree/master/nvvk) and
NVIDIA's [nvpro-samples](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/build_all) framework. This framework contains many advanced
examples and best practices for Vulkan and OpenGL. We also use a helper for the creation of the ray tracing acceleration
structures, but we will document its contents extensively in this tutorial.

!!! Note Note
    For educational purposes all the code is contained in a very small set of files. 
    A real integration would require additional levels of abstraction.

# Environment Setup

**The preferred way** to download the project (including NVVK) is to use the
nvpro-samples `build_all` script.

In a command line, clone the `nvpro-samples/build_all` repository from
[https://github.com/nvpro-samples/build_all](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/build_all):

~~~~~
git clone https://github.com/nvpro-samples/build_all.git
~~~~~

Then open the `build_all` folder and run either `clone_all.bat` (Windows) or
`clone_all.sh` (Linux).

**If you want to clone as few repositories as possible**, open a command line,
and run the following commands to clone the repositories you need:
~~~~~
git clone --recursive --shallow-submodules https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nvpro_core.git
git clone https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_raytracing_tutorial_KHR.git
~~~~~

## Generating the Solution

One typical way to store the build system is to create a `build` directory below the 
main project. You can use CMake-GUI or do the following steps.

~~~~~
cd vk_raytracing_tutorial_KHR
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
~~~~~

!!! Note Note
    If you are not using Visual Studio 2019 and up, make sure to choose x64 platform. For 2019, it is the default
    but not for previous versions.


## Tools Installation

You need a graphics card with support for the `VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline` extension.
For NVIDIA graphics cards, you need a [Vulkan driver](https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver)
released in 2021 or later.

The [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home) 1.2.161 and up will work with this project.
This version was tested with 1.2.182.0.


# Compiling & Running 

Open the solution located in the build directory, then compile and run 
[`vk_ray_tracing__before_KHR`](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_raytracing_tutorial_KHR/tree/master/ray_tracing__before). 

This example will be the starting point of the tutorial. It is a simple framework allowing us to 
load OBJ files and rasterize them using Vulkan. You can find an overview of how this example is done,
see [Base Overview](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_raytracing_tutorial_KHR/blob/master/ray_tracing__before/README.md#nvidia-vulkan-ray-tracing-tutorial).
We will enable ray tracing using this framework, which can load geometries and render scenes. 

![First Run](Images/resultRasterCube.png width="350px")


The following steps in the tutorial will be modifying this project 
`vk_ray_tracing__before_KHR` and will add support for ray tracing. The 
end result of the tutorial is the project `vk_ray_tracing__simple_KHR`.
It is possible to look in that project if something went wrong. 

The project `vk_ray_tracing__simple_KHR` will be the starting point for the 
extra tutorials.


# Ray Tracing Setup

Go to the `main` function of the `main.cpp` file, and find where we request Vulkan extensions with
`nvvk::ContextCreateInfo`.
To be able to use ray tracing, we will need `VK_KHR_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE` and `VK_KHR_RAY_TRACING_PIPELINE`.
Those extensions have also dependencies on other extension, therefore all the following
extensions will need to be added.

~~~~ C
// #VKRay: Activate the ray tracing extension
VkPhysicalDeviceAccelerationStructureFeaturesKHR accelFeature{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_FEATURES_KHR};
contextInfo.addDeviceExtension(VK_KHR_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_EXTENSION_NAME, false, &accelFeature);  // To build acceleration structures
VkPhysicalDeviceRayTracingPipelineFeaturesKHR rtPipelineFeature{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_RAY_TRACING_PIPELINE_FEATURES_KHR};
contextInfo.addDeviceExtension(VK_KHR_RAY_TRACING_PIPELINE_EXTENSION_NAME, false, &rtPipelineFeature);  // To use vkCmdTraceRaysKHR
contextInfo.addDeviceExtension(VK_KHR_DEFERRED_HOST_OPERATIONS_EXTENSION_NAME);  // Required by ray tracing pipeline
~~~~

Behind the scenes, the helper is selecting a physical device supporting the required `VK_KHR_*` extensions,
then placing the `VkPhysicalDevice*FeaturesKHR` structs on the `pNext` chain of `VkDeviceCreateInfo` before
calling `vkCreateDevice`. This enables the ray tracing features and fills in the two structs with info on the
device's ray tracing capabilities. If you are curious, this is done in the Vulkan context creation helper: 
[`Context::initInstance()`](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nvpro_core/blob/1c59039a1ab0d777c79a29b09879a2686ec286dc/nvvk/context_vk.cpp#L211).

!!! NOTE Loading function pointers
    As in OpenGL, when using extensions in Vulkan, you need to manually load in function pointers for extensions, using
    `vkGetInstanceProcAddr` and `vkGetDeviceProcAddr`. The `nvvk::Context` class that this sample depends on magically does
    this for you, for the Vulkan C API by calling [`load_VK_EXTENSIONS`](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nvpro_core/blob/fd6f14c4ddcb6b2ec1e79462d372b32f3838b016/nvvk/extensions_vk.cpp#L2647). 

In the `HelloVulkan` class in `hello_vulkan.h`, add an initialization function and a member storing the capabilities of
the GPU for ray tracing:

~~~~ C
// #VKRay
void                                            initRayTracing();
VkPhysicalDeviceRayTracingPipelinePropertiesKHR m_rtProperties{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_RAY_TRACING_PIPELINE_PROPERTIES_KHR};
~~~~

At the end of `hello_vulkan.cpp`, add the body of `initRayTracing()`, which will query the ray tracing capabilities
of the GPU using this extension. In particular, it will obtain the maximum recursion depth,
i.e. the number of nested ray tracing calls that can be performed from a single ray. This can be seen as the number
of times a ray can bounce in the scene in a recursive path tracer. Note that for performance purposes, recursion
should in practice be kept to a minimum, favoring a loop formulation. This also queries the shader header size,
needed in a later section for creating the shader binding table.


~~~~ C
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Initialize Vulkan ray tracing
// #VKRay
void HelloVulkan::initRayTracing()
{
  // Requesting ray tracing properties
  VkPhysicalDeviceProperties2 prop2{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_PROPERTIES_2};
  prop2.pNext = &m_rtProperties;
  vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2(m_physicalDevice, &prop2);
}
~~~~

## main

In `main.cpp`, in the `main()` function, we call the initialization method right after 
`helloVk.updateDescriptorSet();`

~~~~ C
// #VKRay
helloVk.initRayTracing();
~~~~

!!! Note: Exercise 
    When running the program, you can put a breakpoint in the `initRayTracing()` method to inspect 
    the resulting values. On a Quadro RTX 6000, the maximum recursion depth is 31, and the shader 
    group handle size is 16.

# Acceleration Structure

To be efficient, ray tracing requires organizing the geometry into an acceleration structure (AS)
that will reduce the number of ray-triangle intersection tests during rendering. This is typically implemented 
in hardware as a hierarchical structure, but only two levels are exposed to the user: a single top-level acceleration structure (TLAS)
referencing any number of bottom-level acceleration structures (BLAS), up to the limit
`VkPhysicalDeviceAccelerationStructurePropertiesKHR::maxInstanceCount`. Typically, a BLAS
corresponds to individual 3D models within a scene, and a TLAS corresponds to an entire scene built
by positioning (with 3-by-4 transformation matrices) individual referenced BLASes.

BLASes store the actual vertex data. They are built from one or more vertex
buffers, each with its own transformation matrix (separate from the TLAS matrices), allowing us
to store multiple positioned models within a single BLAS. Note that if an object is instantiated several times within
the same BLAS, its geometry will be duplicated. This can be particularly useful for improving performance
on static, non-instantiated scene components (as a rule of thumb, the fewer BLAS, the better).

The TLAS will contain the object instances, each
with its own transformation matrix and reference to a corresponding BLAS.
We will start with a single bottom-level AS and a top-level AS instancing it once with an identity transform.


![Figure [step]: Acceleration Structure](Images/AccelerationStructure.svg)

This sample loads an OBJ file and stores its indices, vertices and material data into an `ObjModel` structure. This
model is referenced by an `ObjInstance` structure which also contains the transformation matrix of that particular
instance. For ray tracing the `ObjModel` and list of `ObjInstance`s will then naturally fit the BLAS and TLAS, respectively.

To simplify the ray tracing setup we use a helper class that acts as a container for one TLAS referencing an array of BLASes,
with utility functions for building those acceleration structures. In the header file `hello_vulkan.h`, include the `raytrace_vkpp` helper

~~~~ C
// #VKRay
#include "nvvk/raytraceKHR_vk.hpp"
~~~~

so that we can add that helper as a member in the `HelloVulkan` class,

~~~~ C
nvvk::RaytracingBuilderKHR m_rtBuilder;
~~~~

and initialize it at the end of `initRaytracing()`:

~~~~ C
m_rtBuilder.setup(m_device, &m_alloc, m_graphicsQueueIndex);
~~~~

!!! Note Memory Management
    The raytrace helper uses [`"nvvk/resourceallocator_vk.hpp"`](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nvpro_core/blob/master/nvvk/resourceallocator_vk.hpp)
    to avoid having to deal with vulkan memory management.
    This provides the `nvvk::AccelKHR` type, which consists of a `VkAccelerationStructureKHR` paired
    with info needed by the allocator to manage the buffer memory backing it. The resource allocation can use different
    memory allocation strategy (memory allocator). In this tutorial, we are using our own version 
    [DMA](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nvpro_core/blob/master/nvvk/memallocator_dma_vk.hpp).
    Other memory allocators can be selected, such as the [Vulkan Memory Allocator (VMA)](https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator)
    and a dedicated memory allocator, which is the simple one-`VkDeviceMemory`-per-object strategy, 
    which is easiest to understand for teaching purposes but not practical for production use.

## Bottom-Level Acceleration Structure

The first step of building a BLAS object consists in converting the geometry data of an `ObjModel` into
multiple structures consumed by the AS builder. We are holding all those structures under 
`nvvk::RaytracingBuilderKHR::BlasInput`

Add a new method to the `HelloVulkan`
class:

~~~~ C
auto objectToVkGeometryKHR(const ObjModel& model);
~~~~

!!! Note Note
    The `objectToVkGeometryKHR()` function is returning `nvvk::RaytracingBuilderKHR::BlasInput` but we are using the C++ `auto` as it is 
    automatically deducted by the compiler.



Its implementation will fill three structures that will eventually be passed to the AS builder (`vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR`).

* `VkAccelerationStructureGeometryTrianglesDataKHR`: device pointer to the buffers holding triangle vertex/index data,
  along with information for interpreting it as an array (stride, data type, etc.)

* `VkAccelerationStructureGeometryKHR`: wrapper around the above with the geometry type enum (triangles in this case) plus flags
  for the AS builder. This is needed because `VkAccelerationStructureGeometryTrianglesDataKHR` is passed as part of the union
  `VkAccelerationStructureGeometryDataKHR` (the geometry could also be instances, for the TLAS builder, or AABBs, not covered here).

* `VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR`: the indices within the vertex arrays to source input geometry for the BLAS.

!!! Tip VkAccelerationStructureGeometryKHR / VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR split
    A potential point of confusion is how `VkAccelerationStructureGeometryKHR` and `VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR`
    are ultimately passed as separate arguments to the AS builder but work in concert to determine the actual memory to source
    vertices from. As a crude analogy, this is similar to how `glVertexAttribPointer` defines how to interpret a buffer as a vertex
    array while the actual numeric arguments to `glDrawArrays` determine what section of that array is actually drawn.


Multiple of the above structure can be combined in arrays and built into a single BLAS. In this example,
this array will always be a length of one. There would be reason for having multiple geometry per BLAS. The
main reason is the acceleration structure will be more efficient, as it will properly divide the volume with intersecting
objects. This should be concider only for large or complex static group of objects.

Note that we consider all objects opaque for now, and indicate this to the builder for
potential optimization. (More specifically, this disables calls to the anyhit shader, described later).

~~~~ C
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Convert an OBJ model into the ray tracing geometry used to build the BLAS
//
auto HelloVulkan::objectToVkGeometryKHR(const ObjModel& model)
{
  // BLAS builder requires raw device addresses.
  VkDeviceAddress vertexAddress = nvvk::getBufferDeviceAddress(m_device, model.vertexBuffer.buffer);
  VkDeviceAddress indexAddress  = nvvk::getBufferDeviceAddress(m_device, model.indexBuffer.buffer);

  uint32_t maxPrimitiveCount = model.nbIndices / 3;

  // Describe buffer as array of VertexObj.
  VkAccelerationStructureGeometryTrianglesDataKHR triangles{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_GEOMETRY_TRIANGLES_DATA_KHR};
  triangles.vertexFormat             = VK_FORMAT_R32G32B32_SFLOAT;  // vec3 vertex position data.
  triangles.vertexData.deviceAddress = vertexAddress;
  triangles.vertexStride             = sizeof(VertexObj);
  // Describe index data (32-bit unsigned int)
  triangles.indexType               = VK_INDEX_TYPE_UINT32;
  triangles.indexData.deviceAddress = indexAddress;
  // Indicate identity transform by setting transformData to null device pointer.
  //triangles.transformData = {};
  triangles.maxVertex = model.nbVertices;

  // Identify the above data as containing opaque triangles.
  VkAccelerationStructureGeometryKHR asGeom{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_GEOMETRY_KHR};
  asGeom.geometryType       = VK_GEOMETRY_TYPE_TRIANGLES_KHR;
  asGeom.flags              = VK_GEOMETRY_OPAQUE_BIT_KHR;
  asGeom.geometry.triangles = triangles;

  // The entire array will be used to build the BLAS.
  VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR offset;
  offset.firstVertex     = 0;
  offset.primitiveCount  = maxPrimitiveCount;
  offset.primitiveOffset = 0;
  offset.transformOffset = 0;

  // Our blas is made from only one geometry, but could be made of many geometries
  nvvk::RaytracingBuilderKHR::BlasInput input;
  input.asGeometry.emplace_back(asGeom);
  input.asBuildOffsetInfo.emplace_back(offset);

  return input;
}
~~~~

!!! Note Vertex Attributes
    In the above code, we took advantage of the fact that position is the first member of the `VertexObj` struct.
    If it were at any other position, we would have had to manually adjust `vertexAddress` using `offsetof`.
    Only the position attribute is needed for the AS build; later, we will learn to bind the vertex buffers while
    raytracing and look up the other needed attributes manually.

!!! Warning Memory Safety
    `BlasInput` acts essentially as a fancy device pointer to vertex buffer data; no actual vertex data is copied or managed
    by the helper. For this simple example, we are relying on the fact that all models are loaded at
    startup and remain in memory unchanged until the BLAS is created. If you are dynamically loading and unloading parts of a larger
    scene, or dynamically generating vertex data, it is your responsibility to avoid race conditions with the AS builder.

In the `HelloVulkan` class declaration, we can now add the `createBottomLevelAS()` method that will generate a
`nvvk::RaytracingBuilderKHR::BlasInput` for each object, and trigger a BLAS build:

~~~~ C
void createBottomLevelAS();
~~~~

The implementation loops over all the loaded models and fills in an array of `nvvk::RaytracingBuilderKHR::BlasInput` before
triggering a build of all BLASes in a batch. The resulting acceleration structures will be stored
within the helper in the order of construction, so that they can be directly referenced by index later.

~~~~ C
void HelloVulkan::createBottomLevelAS()
{
  // BLAS - Storing each primitive in a geometry
  std::vector<nvvk::RaytracingBuilderKHR::BlasInput> allBlas;
  allBlas.reserve(m_objModel.size());
  for(const auto& obj : m_objModel)
  {
    auto blas = objectToVkGeometryKHR(obj);

    // We could add more geometry in each BLAS, but we add only one for now
    allBlas.emplace_back(blas);
  }
  m_rtBuilder.buildBlas(allBlas, VK_BUILD_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_PREFER_FAST_TRACE_BIT_KHR);
}
~~~~


### Helper Details: RaytracingBuilder::buildBlas()

This helper function is already present in `raytraceKHR_vkpp.hpp`: it can be reused in many projects, and is
part of the set of helpers provided by the [nvpro-samples](https://github.com/nvpro-samples). The function
will generate one BLAS for each `RaytracingBuilderKHR::BlasInput`:

Creating a Bottom-Level-Accelerated-Structure, requires the following elements:

* `VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR` : to create and build the acceleration structure. 
  It is referencing the array of `VkAccelerationStructureGeometryKHR` created in `objectToVkGeometryKHR()`
* `VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR`: a reference to the range, also created in `objectToVkGeometryKHR()`
* `VkAccelerationStructureBuildSizesInfoKHR`: the size require for the creation of the AS and the scratch buffer
* `nvvk::AccelKHR`: the result

The above data will be stored in a structure `BuildAccelerationStructure` to ease the creation.

At the begining of the function, we are only initializing data that we will need later. 

~~~~C
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Create all the BLAS from the vector of BlasInput
// - There will be one BLAS per input-vector entry
// - There will be as many BLAS as input.size()
// - The resulting BLAS (along with the inputs used to build) are stored in m_blas,
//   and can be referenced by index.
// - if flag has the 'Compact' flag, the BLAS will be compacted
//
void nvvk::RaytracingBuilderKHR::buildBlas(const std::vector<BlasInput>& input, VkBuildAccelerationStructureFlagsKHR flags)
{
  m_cmdPool.init(m_device, m_queueIndex);
  uint32_t     nbBlas = static_cast<uint32_t>(input.size());
  VkDeviceSize asTotalSize{0};     // Memory size of all allocated BLAS
  uint32_t     nbCompactions{0};   // Nb of BLAS requesting compaction
  VkDeviceSize maxScratchSize{0};  // Largest scratch size
~~~~ 

The next part is to populate the `BuildAccelerationStructure` for each BLAS, setting the reference to the 
geometry, the build range, the size of the memory needed for the build, and the size of the scratch buffer. 
We will reuse the same scratch memory for each build, so we keep track of the maximum scratch memory ever needed. 
Later, we will allocate a scratch buffer of this size.



~~~~C
// Preparing the information for the acceleration build commands.
std::vector<BuildAccelerationStructure> buildAs(nbBlas);
for(uint32_t idx = 0; idx < nbBlas; idx++)
{
  // Filling partially the VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR for querying the build sizes.
  // Other information will be filled in the createBlas (see #2)
  buildAs[idx].buildInfo.type          = VK_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BOTTOM_LEVEL_KHR;
  buildAs[idx].buildInfo.mode          = VK_BUILD_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_MODE_BUILD_KHR;
  buildAs[idx].buildInfo.flags         = input[idx].flags | flags;
  buildAs[idx].buildInfo.geometryCount = static_cast<uint32_t>(input[idx].asGeometry.size());
  buildAs[idx].buildInfo.pGeometries   = input[idx].asGeometry.data();

  // Build range information
  buildAs[idx].rangeInfo = input[idx].asBuildOffsetInfo.data();

  // Finding sizes to create acceleration structures and scratch
  std::vector<uint32_t> maxPrimCount(input[idx].asBuildOffsetInfo.size());
  for(auto tt = 0; tt < input[idx].asBuildOffsetInfo.size(); tt++)
    maxPrimCount[tt] = input[idx].asBuildOffsetInfo[tt].primitiveCount;  // Number of primitives/triangles
  vkGetAccelerationStructureBuildSizesKHR(m_device, VK_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD_TYPE_DEVICE_KHR,
                                          &buildAs[idx].buildInfo, maxPrimCount.data(), &buildAs[idx].sizeInfo);

  // Extra info
  asTotalSize += buildAs[idx].sizeInfo.accelerationStructureSize;
  maxScratchSize = std::max(maxScratchSize, buildAs[idx].sizeInfo.buildScratchSize);
  nbCompactions += hasFlag(buildAs[idx].buildInfo.flags, VK_BUILD_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_ALLOW_COMPACTION_BIT_KHR);
}
~~~~

After looping over all BLAS, we have the largest scratch buffer size and we will create it.

~~~~ C 
// Allocate the scratch buffers holding the temporary data of the acceleration structure builder
nvvk::Buffer scratchBuffer =
    m_alloc->createBuffer(maxScratchSize, VK_BUFFER_USAGE_SHADER_DEVICE_ADDRESS_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_STORAGE_BUFFER_BIT);
VkBufferDeviceAddressInfo bufferInfo{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_DEVICE_ADDRESS_INFO, nullptr, scratchBuffer.buffer};
VkDeviceAddress           scratchAddress = vkGetBufferDeviceAddress(m_device, &bufferInfo);
~~~~ 

The following section is for querying the real size of each BLAS. 
To know the size that the BLAS is really taking, we use queries of the type `VK_QUERY_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_COMPACTED_SIZE_KHR`.
This is needed if we want to compact the acceleration structure in a second step. By default, the 
size returned by `vkGetAccelerationStructureBuildSizesKHR` has the size of the worst case. After creation,
the real space can be smaller, and it is possible to copy the acceleration structure to one that is 
using exactly what is needed. This could save over 50% of the device memory usage.

~~~~ C
// Allocate a query pool for storing the needed size for every BLAS compaction.
VkQueryPool queryPool{VK_NULL_HANDLE};
if(nbCompactions > 0)  // Is compaction requested?
{
  assert(nbCompactions == nbBlas);  // Don't allow mix of on/off compaction
  VkQueryPoolCreateInfo qpci{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_QUERY_POOL_CREATE_INFO};
  qpci.queryCount = nbBlas;
  qpci.queryType  = VK_QUERY_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_COMPACTED_SIZE_KHR;
  vkCreateQueryPool(m_device, &qpci, nullptr, &queryPool);
}
~~~~

!!! Note Compaction
    To use compaction the BLAS flag must have VK_BUILD_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_ALLOW_COMPACTION_BIT_KHR


Creating all BLAS in a single command buffer might work, but it could stall the pipeline and potentially create problems.
To avoid this potential problem, we split the BLAS creation into chunks of ~256MB of required memory. 
And if we request compaction, we will do it immediately, thus limiting the memory allocation required.

See below for the split of BLAS creation. The function `cmdCreateBlas` and `cmdCompactBlas` will be detailed later.


~~~~ C 
// Batching creation/compaction of BLAS to allow staying in restricted amount of memory
std::vector<uint32_t> indices;  // Indices of the BLAS to create
VkDeviceSize          batchSize{0};
VkDeviceSize          batchLimit{256'000'000};  // 256 MB
for(uint32_t idx = 0; idx < nbBlas; idx++)
{
  indices.push_back(idx);
  batchSize += buildAs[idx].sizeInfo.accelerationStructureSize;
  // Over the limit or last BLAS element
  if(batchSize >= batchLimit || idx == nbBlas - 1)
  {
    VkCommandBuffer cmdBuf = m_cmdPool.createCommandBuffer();
    cmdCreateBlas(cmdBuf, indices, buildAs, scratchAddress, queryPool);
    m_cmdPool.submitAndWait(cmdBuf);

    if(queryPool)
    {
      VkCommandBuffer cmdBuf = m_cmdPool.createCommandBuffer();
      cmdCompactBlas(cmdBuf, indices, buildAs, queryPool);
      m_cmdPool.submitAndWait(cmdBuf);  // Submit command buffer and call vkQueueWaitIdle

      // Destroy the non-compacted version
      destroyNonCompacted(indices, buildAs);
    }
    // Reset

    batchSize = 0;
    indices.clear();
  }
}
~~~~ 

The created acceleration structure is kept in this class, such that it can be retrieved with the index of creation. 

~~~~ C
// Keeping all the created acceleration structures
for(auto& b : buildAs)
{
  m_blas.emplace_back(b.as);
}
~~~~ 

Finally we are cleaning up what we use. 

~~~~ C
// Clean up
vkDestroyQueryPool(m_device, queryPool, nullptr);
m_alloc->finalizeAndReleaseStaging();
m_alloc->destroy(scratchBuffer);
m_cmdPool.deinit();
~~~~ 

#### cmdCreateBlas 

~~~~ C
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Creating the bottom level acceleration structure for all indices of `buildAs` vector.
// The array of BuildAccelerationStructure was created in buildBlas and the vector of
// indices limits the number of BLAS to create at once. This limits the amount of
// memory needed when compacting the BLAS.
void nvvk::RaytracingBuilderKHR::cmdCreateBlas(VkCommandBuffer                          cmdBuf,
                                               std::vector<uint32_t>                    indices,
                                               std::vector<BuildAccelerationStructure>& buildAs,
                                               VkDeviceAddress                          scratchAddress,
                                               VkQueryPool                              queryPool)
{
~~~~ 

First we reset the query to know the real size of the BLAS

~~~~C
if(queryPool)  // For querying the compaction size
  vkResetQueryPool(m_device, queryPool, 0, static_cast<uint32_t>(indices.size()));
uint32_t queryCnt{0};
~~~~ 

This function is creating all the BLAS defined by the index chunk. 

~~~~ C
for(const auto& idx : indices)
{
~~~~


The creation of the BLAS consist in two steps: 

* Creating the acceleration structure: we use `createAcceleration()` from our memory allocator abstraction and
  the information about the size we get earlier. This will create the buffer and acceleration structure.
* Building the acceleration structure: with the acceleration structure, the scratch buffer and information on the geometry,
  this makes the actual build of the BLAS. 


Behind the scenes, `m_alloc->createAcceleration` is creating a buffer of the size indicated by the acceleration structure
size query, giving it the `VK_BUFFER_USAGE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_STORAGE_BIT_KHR` and `VK_BUFFER_USAGE_SHADER_DEVICE_ADDRESS_BIT`
usage bits (the latter is needed as the TLAS builder will need the raw address of the BLASes), and binding the acceleration structure
to its allocated memory by filling in the `buffer` field of `VkAccelerationStructureCreateInfoKHR`. Unlike buffers and images,
where `Vk*` handle allocation and memory binding is done in separate steps, an acceleration structure is both created and bound
to memory with one `vkCreateAccelerationStructureKHR` call.


~~~~ C
// Actual allocation of buffer and acceleration structure.
VkAccelerationStructureCreateInfoKHR createInfo{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_CREATE_INFO_KHR};
createInfo.type = VK_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BOTTOM_LEVEL_KHR;
createInfo.size = buildAs[idx].sizeInfo.accelerationStructureSize;  // Will be used to allocate memory.
buildAs[idx].as = m_alloc->createAcceleration(createInfo);
NAME_IDX_VK(buildAs[idx].as.accel, idx);
NAME_IDX_VK(buildAs[idx].as.buffer.buffer, idx);

// BuildInfo #2 part
buildAs[idx].buildInfo.dstAccelerationStructure  = buildAs[idx].as.accel;  // Setting where the build lands
buildAs[idx].buildInfo.scratchData.deviceAddress = scratchAddress;  // All build are using the same scratch buffer

// Building the bottom-level-acceleration-structure
vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR(cmdBuf, 1, &buildAs[idx].buildInfo, &buildAs[idx].rangeInfo);
~~~~


Note the barrier after each call to the build: For the sake of simplicity we are reusing scratch space across builds, 
so we need to make sure the previous build is finished before starting the next one. 
Ideally, we should have used multiple regions of a scratch buffer so multiple BLAS could be built simultaneously.

~~~~ C
// Since the scratch buffer is reused across builds, we need a barrier to ensure one build
// is finished before starting the next one.
VkMemoryBarrier barrier{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_MEMORY_BARRIER};
barrier.srcAccessMask = VK_ACCESS_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_WRITE_BIT_KHR;
barrier.dstAccessMask = VK_ACCESS_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_READ_BIT_KHR;
vkCmdPipelineBarrier(cmdBuf, VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD_BIT_KHR,
                     VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD_BIT_KHR, 0, 1, &barrier, 0, nullptr, 0, nullptr);
~~~~

Then we add the size query only if needed 

~~~~ C
if(queryPool)
{
  // Add a query to find the 'real' amount of memory needed, use for compaction
  vkCmdWriteAccelerationStructuresPropertiesKHR(cmdBuf, 1, &buildAs[idx].buildInfo.dstAccelerationStructure,
                                                VK_QUERY_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_COMPACTED_SIZE_KHR, queryPool, queryCnt++);
}
}
}
~~~~ 


Although this approach has the advantage of keeping all BLAS independent, building many BLAS efficiently would require allocating a larger scratch buffer and launching multiple builds simultaneously.
This current tutorial does not use compaction, which could significantly reduce the memory footprint of the acceleration structures. These two aspects will be part of a future advanced tutorial.


#### cmdCompactBlas

What follows is when the compact flag is set. This part, which is optional, will compact the BLAS into the memory 
it actually uses. We have to wait until all BLAS are built, to make a copy in the more suitable memory space. 
This is the reason why we used `m_cmdPool.submitAndWait(cmdBuf)` before calling this function.


~~~~ C 
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Create and replace a new acceleration structure and buffer based on the size retrieved by the
// Query.
void nvvk::RaytracingBuilderKHR::cmdCompactBlas(VkCommandBuffer                          cmdBuf,
                                                std::vector<uint32_t>                    indices,

{
~~~~

In broad terms, compaction works as follows: 

* Get the values from the query 
* Create a new acceleration structure with the smaller size
* Copy the previous acceleration structure to the new allocated one
* Destroy previous acceleration structure. 

~~~~ C 
uint32_t                    queryCtn{0};

## Top-Level Acceleration Structure

The TLAS is the entry point in the ray tracing scene description, and stores all the instances. Add a new method
to the `HelloVulkan` class:

~~~~ C
void createTopLevelAS();
~~~~

We represent an instance with `VkAccelerationStructureInstanceKHR`, which stores its transform matrix (`transform`)
a reference of its corresponding BLAS (`blasId`) in the vector passed to `buildBlas`. It also contains an instance identifier that will
be available during shading as `gl_InstanceCustomIndex`, as well as the index of the hit group that represents the shaders that will be
invoked upon hitting the object (`VkAccelerationStructureInstanceKHR::instanceShaderBindingTableRecordOffset`, a.k.a. `hitGroupId` in the helper).

!!! WARNING gl_InstanceId
    Do not confuse `gl_InstanceID` with `gl_InstanceCustomIndex`. The `gl_InstanceID` is simply
    the index of the intersected instance as it appeared in the array of instances used to build
    the TLAS.
    
    In this specific example, we could have ignored the custom index, since the Id
    will be equivalent to `gl_InstanceId` (as `gl_InstanceId` specifies the index of the
    instance that intersects the current ray, which is in this case the same value as `i`).
    In later examples the value will be different.

This index and the notion of hit group are tied to the definition of the ray tracing pipeline and the Shader Binding
Table, described later in this tutorial and used to select determine which shaders are invoked at runtime. For now
it suffices to say that we will use only one hit group for the whole scene, and hence the hit group index is always 0.
Finally, the instance may indicate culling preferences, such as backface culling, using its `VkGeometryInstanceFlagsKHR
flags` member. In our example we decide to disable culling altogether
for simplicity and independence on the winding of the input models.

Once all the instance objects are created we trigger the TLAS build, directing the builder to prefer generating a TLAS
optimized for tracing performance (rather than AS size, for example).

~~~~ C
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//
void HelloVulkan::createTopLevelAS()
{
  std::vector<VkAccelerationStructureInstanceKHR> tlas;
  tlas.reserve(m_instances.size());
  for(const HelloVulkan::ObjInstance& inst : m_instances)
  {
    VkAccelerationStructureInstanceKHR rayInst{};
    rayInst.transform                      = nvvk::toTransformMatrixKHR(inst.transform);  // Position of the instance
    rayInst.instanceCustomIndex            = inst.objIndex;                               // gl_InstanceCustomIndexEXT
    rayInst.accelerationStructureReference = m_rtBuilder.getBlasDeviceAddress(inst.objIndex);
    rayInst.flags                          = VK_GEOMETRY_INSTANCE_TRIANGLE_FACING_CULL_DISABLE_BIT_KHR;
    rayInst.mask                           = 0xFF;       //  Only be hit if rayMask & instance.mask != 0
    rayInst.instanceShaderBindingTableRecordOffset = 0;  // We will use the same hit group for all objects
    tlas.emplace_back(rayInst);
  }
  m_rtBuilder.buildTlas(tlas, VK_BUILD_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_PREFER_FAST_TRACE_BIT_KHR);
}
~~~~

As usual in Vulkan, we need to explicitly destroy the objects we created by adding a call at the end of 
`HelloVulkan::destroyResources`:

~~~~ C
  // #VKRay
  m_rtBuilder.destroy();
~~~~

!!! Note getBlasDeviceAddress()
    `getBlasDeviceAddress()` returns the acceleration structure device address of the `blasId`. The id correspond to 
    the created BLAS in `buildBlas`.

### Helper Details: RaytracingBuilder::buildTlas()

The helper function for building top-level acceleration structures is part of the
[nvpro-samples](https://github.com/nvpro-samples)
and builds a TLAS from a vector of `Instance` objects.

We first set up a command buffer and copy the user's TLAS flags.

~~~~ C
  // Creating the top-level acceleration structure from the vector of Instance
  // - See struct of Instance
  // - The resulting TLAS will be stored in m_tlas
  // - update is to rebuild the Tlas with updated matrices
  void buildTlas(const std::vector<VkAccelerationStructureInstanceKHR>&         instances,
                 VkBuildAccelerationStructureFlagsKHR flags = VK_BUILD_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_PREFER_FAST_TRACE_BIT_KHR,
                 bool                                 update = false)
  {
    // Cannot call buildTlas twice except to update.
    assert(m_tlas.accel == VK_NULL_HANDLE || update);
    uint32_t countInstance = static_cast<uint32_t>(instances.size());

    // Command buffer to create the TLAS
    nvvk::CommandPool genCmdBuf(m_device, m_queueIndex);
    VkCommandBuffer   cmdBuf = genCmdBuf.createCommandBuffer();
~~~~

Next, we need to upload the Vulkan instances to the device.

~~~~ C
    // Command buffer to create the TLAS
    nvvk::CommandPool genCmdBuf(m_device, m_queueIndex);
    VkCommandBuffer   cmdBuf = genCmdBuf.createCommandBuffer();

    // Create a buffer holding the actual instance data (matrices++) for use by the AS builder
    nvvk::Buffer instancesBuffer;  // Buffer of instances containing the matrices and BLAS ids
    instancesBuffer = m_alloc->createBuffer(cmdBuf, instances,
                                            VK_BUFFER_USAGE_SHADER_DEVICE_ADDRESS_BIT
                                                | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD_INPUT_READ_ONLY_BIT_KHR);
    NAME_VK(instancesBuffer.buffer);
    VkBufferDeviceAddressInfo bufferInfo{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_DEVICE_ADDRESS_INFO, nullptr, instancesBuffer.buffer};
    VkDeviceAddress           instBufferAddr = vkGetBufferDeviceAddress(m_device, &bufferInfo);

    // Make sure the copy of the instance buffer are copied before triggering the acceleration structure build
    VkMemoryBarrier barrier{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_MEMORY_BARRIER};
    barrier.srcAccessMask = VK_ACCESS_TRANSFER_WRITE_BIT;
    barrier.dstAccessMask = VK_ACCESS_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_WRITE_BIT_KHR;
    vkCmdPipelineBarrier(cmdBuf, VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_TRANSFER_BIT, VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD_BIT_KHR,
                         0, 1, &barrier, 0, nullptr, 0, nullptr);
~~~~

At this point, we have a command buffer (`cmdBuf`), a number of instances(`countInstance`) and the address of the buffer holding
all the `VkAccelerationStructureInstanceKHR`. With this information, we call a function that will build the TLAS. This function
will allocate a scratch buffer that we will need to destroy once all work is done. 

~~~~C
    // Creating the TLAS
    nvvk::Buffer scratchBuffer;
    cmdCreateTlas(cmdBuf, countInstance, instBufferAddr, scratchBuffer, flags, update, motion);

    // Finalizing and destroying temporary data
    genCmdBuf.submitAndWait(cmdBuf);  // queueWaitIdle inside.
    m_alloc->finalizeAndReleaseStaging();
    m_alloc->destroy(scratchBuffer);
    m_alloc->destroy(instancesBuffer);
}
~~~~

This lower function is the actual construction of the top-level-acceleration-structure. 

~~~~ C
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Low level of Tlas creation - see buildTlas
//
void nvvk::RaytracingBuilderKHR::cmdCreateTlas(VkCommandBuffer                      cmdBuf,
                                               uint32_t                             countInstance,
                                               VkDeviceAddress                      instBufferAddr,
                                               nvvk::Buffer&                        scratchBuffer,
                                               VkBuildAccelerationStructureFlagsKHR flags,
                                               bool                                 update,
                                               bool                                 motion)
{
~~~~

The next part is filling the structures for building the TLAS. It is one geometry containing many instances. 

~~~~C
  // Wraps a device pointer to the above uploaded instances.
  VkAccelerationStructureGeometryInstancesDataKHR instancesVk{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_GEOMETRY_INSTANCES_DATA_KHR};
  instancesVk.data.deviceAddress = instBufferAddr;

  // Put the above into a VkAccelerationStructureGeometryKHR. We need to put the instances struct in a union and label it as instance data.
  VkAccelerationStructureGeometryKHR topASGeometry{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_GEOMETRY_KHR};
  topASGeometry.geometryType       = VK_GEOMETRY_TYPE_INSTANCES_KHR;
  topASGeometry.geometry.instances = instancesVk;

  // Find sizes
  VkAccelerationStructureBuildGeometryInfoKHR buildInfo{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD_GEOMETRY_INFO_KHR};
  buildInfo.flags         = flags;
  buildInfo.geometryCount = 1;
  buildInfo.pGeometries   = &topASGeometry;
  buildInfo.mode = update ? VK_BUILD_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_MODE_UPDATE_KHR : VK_BUILD_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_MODE_BUILD_KHR;
  buildInfo.type                     = VK_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_TYPE_TOP_LEVEL_KHR;
  buildInfo.srcAccelerationStructure = VK_NULL_HANDLE;

  VkAccelerationStructureBuildSizesInfoKHR sizeInfo{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD_SIZES_INFO_KHR};
  vkGetAccelerationStructureBuildSizesKHR(m_device, VK_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD_TYPE_DEVICE_KHR, &buildInfo,
                                          &countInstance, &sizeInfo);

~~~~

We can create the acceleration structure, not building it yet.

~~~~C
    VkAccelerationStructureCreateInfoKHR createInfo{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_CREATE_INFO_KHR};
    createInfo.type = VK_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_TYPE_TOP_LEVEL_KHR;
    createInfo.size = sizeInfo.accelerationStructureSize;

    m_tlas = m_alloc->createAcceleration(createInfo);
    NAME_VK(m_tlas.accel);
    NAME_VK(m_tlas.buffer.buffer);

~~~~

Building the acceleration structure, also requires to create a scratch buffer.

~~~~C

  // Allocate the scratch memory
  scratchBuffer = m_alloc->createBuffer(sizeInfo.buildScratchSize,
                                        VK_BUFFER_USAGE_STORAGE_BUFFER_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_SHADER_DEVICE_ADDRESS_BIT);

  VkBufferDeviceAddressInfo bufferInfo{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_DEVICE_ADDRESS_INFO, nullptr, scratchBuffer.buffer};
  VkDeviceAddress           scratchAddress = vkGetBufferDeviceAddress(m_device, &bufferInfo);
  NAME_VK(scratchBuffer.buffer);

~~~~

Finally, we can build the acceleration structure.
  
~~~~C
  // Update build information
  buildInfo.srcAccelerationStructure  = VK_NULL_HANDLE;
  buildInfo.dstAccelerationStructure  = m_tlas.accel;
  buildInfo.scratchData.deviceAddress = scratchAddress;

  // Build Offsets info: n instances
  VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR        buildOffsetInfo{countInstance, 0, 0, 0};
  const VkAccelerationStructureBuildRangeInfoKHR* pBuildOffsetInfo = &buildOffsetInfo;

  // Build the TLAS
  vkCmdBuildAccelerationStructuresKHR(cmdBuf, 1, &buildInfo, &pBuildOffsetInfo);
}
~~~~

## main

In the `main` function, we can now add the creation of the geometry instances and acceleration structures
 right after initializing ray tracing:

~~~~ C
// #VKRay
helloVk.initRayTracing();
helloVk.createBottomLevelAS();
helloVk.createTopLevelAS();
~~~~

# Ray Tracing Descriptor Set

The ray tracing shaders, like the rasterization shaders, use external resources referenced by a descriptor set. With the
rasterization graphics pipeline, when drawing a scene using different materials, we can group objects by material and
order draws by material used. A material's pipeline and descriptors only need to be bound when drawing objects of that material.

In contrast, with ray tracing, it is not possible to know in advance which objects will be hit by a ray, so any shader may
be invoked at any time. The Vulkan ray tracing extension then uses a single set of descriptor sets containing all the
resources necessary to render the scene: for example, it would contain all the textures for all the materials.
Additionally, since the acceleration structure holds only position data, we need to pass the original vertex and index
buffers to the shaders, so that we can manually look up the other vertex attributes.

To maintain compatibility between rasterization and ray tracing, we will re-use, from the old rasterization renderer,
the descriptor set containing the scene information, and will add another descriptor set referencing the TLAS and the
buffer in which we store the output image.

In the header `hello_vulkan.h`, we declare the objects related to this additional descriptor set:

~~~~ C
  void           createRtDescriptorSet();

  nvvk::DescriptorSetBindings                     m_rtDescSetLayoutBind;
  VkDescriptorPool                                m_rtDescPool;
  VkDescriptorSetLayout                           m_rtDescSetLayout;
  VkDescriptorSet                                 m_rtDescSet;
~~~~

The acceleration structure will be accessible by the Ray Generation shader, as we want to call `TraceRayEXT()` from this
shader. Later in this document, we will also make it accessible from the Closest Hit shader, in order to send rays from
there as well. The output image is the offscreen image used by the rasterization, and will be written only by the
RayGen shader.

~~~~ C
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This descriptor set holds the Acceleration structure and the output image
//
void HelloVulkan::createRtDescriptorSet()
{
  m_rtDescSetLayoutBind.addBinding(RtxBindings::eTlas, VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_KHR, 1,
                                   VK_SHADER_STAGE_RAYGEN_BIT_KHR);  // TLAS
  m_rtDescSetLayoutBind.addBinding(RtxBindings::eOutImage, VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_IMAGE, 1,

  m_rtDescPool      = m_rtDescSetLayoutBind.createPool(m_device);
  m_rtDescSetLayout = m_rtDescSetLayoutBind.createLayout(m_device);

  VkDescriptorSetAllocateInfo allocateInfo{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_DESCRIPTOR_SET_ALLOCATE_INFO};
  allocateInfo.descriptorPool     = m_rtDescPool;
  allocateInfo.descriptorSetCount = 1;
  allocateInfo.pSetLayouts        = &m_rtDescSetLayout;
  vkAllocateDescriptorSets(m_device, &allocateInfo, &m_rtDescSet);


  VkAccelerationStructureKHR                   tlas = m_rtBuilder.getAccelerationStructure();

  std::vector<VkWriteDescriptorSet> writes;
  writes.emplace_back(m_rtDescSetLayoutBind.makeWrite(m_rtDescSet, RtxBindings::eTlas, &descASInfo));
  writes.emplace_back(m_rtDescSetLayoutBind.makeWrite(m_rtDescSet, RtxBindings::eOutImage, &imageInfo));
  vkUpdateDescriptorSets(m_device, static_cast<uint32_t>(writes.size()), writes.data(), 0, nullptr);
}
~~~~

## Additions to the Scene Descriptor Set

As the ray tracing shaders also have to access the scene description, we need to extend the access flags of the
corresponding buffers in the original `createDescriptorSetLayout()`. The RayGen should access the camera matrices to
compute ray directions, and the ClosestHit needs access to the materials, scene instances, textures, vertex buffers, and
index buffers. Even though the vertex and index buffers will only be used by the ray tracing shaders we add them to this
descriptor set as they semantically fit the Scene descriptor set.

~~~~ C
// Camera matrices
m_descSetLayoutBind.addBinding(SceneBindings::eGlobals, VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER, 1,
                               VK_SHADER_STAGE_VERTEX_BIT | VK_SHADER_STAGE_RAYGEN_BIT_KHR);
// Obj descriptions
m_descSetLayoutBind.addBinding(SceneBindings::eObjDescs, VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_STORAGE_BUFFER, 1,
                               VK_SHADER_STAGE_VERTEX_BIT | VK_SHADER_STAGE_FRAGMENT_BIT | VK_SHADER_STAGE_CLOSEST_HIT_BIT_KHR);
// Textures
m_descSetLayoutBind.addBinding(SceneBindings::eTextures, VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER, nbTxt,
                               VK_SHADER_STAGE_FRAGMENT_BIT | VK_SHADER_STAGE_CLOSEST_HIT_BIT_KHR);
~~~~

Originally the buffers containing the vertices and indices were only used by the rasterization pipeline. 
The ray tracing will need to use those buffers as storage buffers, so we add `VK_BUFFER_USAGE_STORAGE_BUFFER_BIT`;
additionally, the buffers will be read by the acceleration structure builder, which requires raw device addresses
(in `VkAccelerationStructureGeometryTrianglesDataKHR`), so the buffer also needs
 `VK_BUFFER_USAGE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD_INPUT_READ_ONLY_BIT_KHR` bits.

We update the usage of the buffers in `loadModel`:

~~~~ C
VkBufferUsageFlags flag   = VK_BUFFER_USAGE_SHADER_DEVICE_ADDRESS_BIT;
VkBufferUsageFlags rayTracingFlags = // used also for building acceleration structures 
    flag | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_BUILD_INPUT_READ_ONLY_BIT_KHR | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_STORAGE_BUFFER_BIT;
model.vertexBuffer   = m_alloc.createBuffer(cmdBuf, loader.m_vertices, VK_BUFFER_USAGE_VERTEX_BUFFER_BIT | rayTracingFlags);
model.indexBuffer    = m_alloc.createBuffer(cmdBuf, loader.m_indices, VK_BUFFER_USAGE_INDEX_BUFFER_BIT | rayTracingFlags);
model.matColorBuffer = m_alloc.createBuffer(cmdBuf, loader.m_materials, VK_BUFFER_USAGE_STORAGE_BUFFER_BIT | flag);
model.matIndexBuffer = m_alloc.createBuffer(cmdBuf, loader.m_matIndx, VK_BUFFER_USAGE_STORAGE_BUFFER_BIT | flag);
~~~~

!!! Note: Array of Buffers 
    Each model (OBJ) was constructed with a buffer of vertices, indices, and materials. Therefore the 
    scene has vectors of those buffers. In the shaders, we access the right buffer using the 
    the ObjectID used by the Instance. This is convenient, as we have access to all the data 
    of the scene while ray tracing.

## Descriptor Update

As with the rasterization descriptor set, the ray tracing descriptor set needs to be updated if its contents change.
This typically happens when resizing the window, as the output image is recreated and needs to be re-linked to the
descriptor set. The update is performed in a new method of the `HelloVulkan` class:

~~~~ C
void updateRtDescriptorSet();
~~~~

The implementation is straightforward, just update the output image reference:

~~~~ C
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Writes the output image to the descriptor set
// - Required when changing resolution
//
void HelloVulkan::updateRtDescriptorSet()
{
  // (1) Output buffer
  VkDescriptorImageInfo imageInfo{{}, m_offscreenColor.descriptor.imageView, VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_GENERAL};
  VkWriteDescriptorSet  wds = m_rtDescSetLayoutBind.makeWrite(m_rtDescSet, RtxBindings::eOutImage, &imageInfo);
  vkUpdateDescriptorSets(m_device, 1, &wds, 0, nullptr);
}
~~~~

!!! Note Note
    We are using [`nvvk::DescriptorSetBindings`](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nvpro_core/tree/master/nvvk#class-nvvkdescriptorsetbindings) 
    to help creating the descriptor sets. This removes a lot of duplacted code and potential errors. 


We can then add the update call to the `onResize()` method to link it to the resizing event:

~~~~ C
  updateRtDescriptorSet();
~~~~

The resources created in this section need to be destroyed when closing the application by adding the following to
`destroyResources`:

~~~~ C
vkDestroyDescriptorPool(m_device, m_rtDescPool, nullptr);
vkDestroyDescriptorSetLayout(m_device, m_rtDescSetLayout, nullptr);
~~~~

## main

In the `main` function, we create the descriptor set after the other ray tracing calls:

~~~~ C
  helloVk.createRtDescriptorSet();
~~~~

# Ray Tracing Pipeline

As mentioned earlier, when ray tracing, unlike rasterization, we cannot group draws by material, so, every shader must be
available for execution at any time when ray tracing, and the shaders executed are selected on the device at runtime.
The ultimate goal of the next two sections is to assemble a Shader Binding Table (SBT): the structure
that makes this runtime shader selection possible. This is essentially a table of opaque shader handles (probably device
addresses), analagous to a `C++` vtable, except that we have to build this table ourselves (also, the user can smuggle additional
information in the SBT using `shaderRecordEXT`, not covered here). The steps to do so are:

* Load and compile shaders into `VkShaderModule`s in the usual way.

* Package those `VkShaderModule`s into an array of `VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo`.

* Create an array of `VkRayTracingShaderGroupCreateInfoKHR`; each will eventually become an SBT entry.
  At this point, the shader groups reference individual shaders by their index in the above `VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo`
  array as no device addresses have yet been allocated.

* Compile the above two arrays (plus a pipeline layout, as usual) into a raytracing pipeline using `vkCreateRayTracingPipelineKHR`.

* The pipeline compilation converted the earlier array of shader indices into an array of shader handles.
  Query this with `vkGetRayTracingShaderGroupHandlesKHR`.

* Allocate a buffer with the `VK_BUFFER_USAGE_SHADER_BINDING_TABLE_BIT_KHR` usage bit, and copy the handles in.

The ray trace pipeline behaves more like the compute pipeline than the rasterization graphics pipeline. Ray traces
are dispatched in an abstract 3D `width/height/depth` space, with results manually written using `imageStore`. However,
unlike the compute pipeline, you dispatch individual shader invocations, rather than local groups. The entry point for ray tracing is

* The **ray generation** shader, which we will call for each pixel. It will
  typically initialize a ray starting at the location of the camera, in a direction given by evaluating the camera lens
  model at the pixel location. It will then invoke `traceRayEXT()`, that will shoot the ray in the scene. `traceRayEXT`
  invokes the next few shader types, which communicate results using ray trace payloads.

Ray trace payloads are declared as `rayPayloadEXT` or `rayPayloadInEXT` variables; together, they establish
a caller/callee relationship between shader stages. Each invocation of a shader creates its own local copy
of its declared `rayPayloadEXT` variables, when invoking another shader by calling `traceRayEXT()`,
the caller can select one of its payloads to be made visible to the
callee shader as its `rayPayloadInEXT` variable (also known as the "incoming payload").

Declare payloads wisely, as excessive memory usage reduces SM occupancy (parallelism).

The next two shader types should be used:

* The **miss** shader is executed when a ray does not intersect any geometry. For instance, it might sample an
  environment map, or return a simple color through the ray payload.

* The **closest hit** shader is called upon hitting the geometric instance closest to the starting point of the ray.
  This shader can for example perform lighting calculations and return the results through the ray payload. There can be
  as many closest hit shaders as needed, much like how a rasterization-based application has multiple pixel shaders
  depending on its objects.

Two more shader types can optionally be used:

* The **intersection** shader, which allows intersecting user-defined geometry. For example, this can be used to
  intersect geometry placeholders for on-demand geometry loading, or intersecting procedural geometry without tessellating
  them beforehand. Using this shader requires modifying how the acceleration structures are built, and is beyond the scope
  of this tutorial. We will instead rely on the built-in ray-triangle intersection test provided by the extension, which
  returns 2 floating-point values representing the barycentric coordinates `(u,v)` of the hit point inside the triangle.
  For a triangle made of vertices `v0`, `v1`, `v2`, the barycentric coordinates define the weights of the vertices as
  follows:

***********************
*            . u      *
*           / \       *
*          / v1\      *
*         /     \     *
*        /       \    *
* 1-u-v / v0   v2 \ v *
*      '-----------'  *
***********************
  
 
* The **any hit** shader is executed on each potential intersection: when searching for the hit point closest to the ray
  origin, several candidates may be found on the way. The any hit shader can frequently be used to efficiently implement
  alpha-testing. If the alpha test fails, the ray traversal can continue without having to call `traceRayEXT()` again. The
  built-in any hit shader is simply a pass-through returning the intersection to the traversal engine, which will
  determine which ray intersection is the closest. For this example, such shaders will never be invoked as we specified the
  opaque flag while building the acceleration structures.

![Figure [step]: The Ray Tracing Pipeline](Images/ShaderPipeline.svg)

We will start with a pipeline containing only the 3 main shader programs: a single ray generation shader, a single miss
shader, and a single hit group made only of a closest hit shader. This is done by first compiling each GLSL shader
program into SPIR-V. These SPIR-V shaders will be linked together into a ray tracing pipeline, which will be able to
route the intersection calculations to the right hit shaders.

To be able to focus on the pipeline generation, we provide simple shaders:

## Adding Shaders

!!! Note: [Download Ray Tracing Shaders](files/shaders.zip)
    Download the shaders and extract the content into `src/shaders`. Then rerun CMake, which will add those files to the project.

The `shaders` folder now contains 3 more files:

* `raytrace.rgen` contains the ray generation program. It also declares its access to the ray tracing output buffer
  `image`, and the ray tracing acceleration structure `topLevelAS`, bound as an `accelerationStructureKHR`. For now this
  shader program simply writes a constant color into the output buffer.

* `raytrace.rmiss` defines the miss shader. This shader will be executed when no geometry is hit, and will write a
  constant color into the ray payload `rayPayloadInEXT`. Since our current ray generation program does not trace any rays
  for now, this shader will not be called.

* `raytrace.rchit` contains a very simple closest hit shader. It will be executed upon hitting the geometry (our
  triangles). As the miss shader, it takes the ray payload `rayPayloadInEXT`. It also has a second input defining the
  intersection attributes `hitAttributeEXT` (i.e. the barycentric coordinates) as provided by the built-in
  triangle-ray intersection test. This shader simply writes a constant color to the payload.

In the header file, let's add the definition of the ray tracing pipeline building method, and the storage members of the
pipeline:

~~~~ C
void                                              createRtPipeline();

std::vector<VkRayTracingShaderGroupCreateInfoKHR> m_rtShaderGroups;
VkPipelineLayout                                  m_rtPipelineLayout;
VkPipeline                                        m_rtPipeline;
~~~~

The pipeline will also use push constants to store global uniform values, namely the background color and
the light source information. Since we are setting the information on host and using it on device, this 
structure will be set in `shaders/host_device.h`.

~~~~ C
// Push constant structure for the ray tracer
struct PushConstantRay
{
  vec4  clearColor;
  vec3  lightPosition;
  float lightIntensity;
  int   lightType;
};
~~~~

In `HelloVulkan` class, add a member for the push constant

~~~~ C 
// Push constant for ray tracer
PushConstantRay m_pcRay{};
~~~~ 

Our implementation of the ray tracing pipeline generation starts by adding the ray generation and miss shader stages,
followed by the closest hit shader. Note that this order is arbitrary, as the extension allows the developer to set up
the pipeline in any order. The "stages" terminology is a holdover from the rasterization pipeline; in raytracing,
we orchestrate the order that shaders are invoked and the data flow between them ourselves.

All stages are stored in an `std::vector` of `VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo` objects. As mentioned, at this step,
indices within this vector will be used as unique identifiers for the shaders. The 3 stages will be using the
same entry point "main". Then we create a `vkCreateShaderModule` from the pre-compiled shader and defined which
stage it correspond to. 

~~~~ C
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Pipeline for the ray tracer: all shaders, raygen, chit, miss
//
void HelloVulkan::createRtPipeline()
{
  enum StageIndices
  {
    eRaygen,
    eMiss,
    eClosestHit,
    eShaderGroupCount 
  };

  // All stages
  std::array<VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo, eShaderGroupCount> stages{};
  VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo              stage{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_SHADER_STAGE_CREATE_INFO};
  stage.pName = "main";  // All the same entry point
  // Raygen
  stage.module = nvvk::createShaderModule(m_device, nvh::loadFile("spv/raytrace.rgen.spv", true, defaultSearchPaths, true));
  stage.stage    = VK_SHADER_STAGE_RAYGEN_BIT_KHR;
  stages[eRaygen] = stage;
  // Miss
  stage.module = nvvk::createShaderModule(m_device, nvh::loadFile("spv/raytrace.rmiss.spv", true, defaultSearchPaths, true));
  stage.stage  = VK_SHADER_STAGE_MISS_BIT_KHR;
  stages[eMiss] = stage;
  // Hit Group - Closest Hit
  stage.module = nvvk::createShaderModule(m_device, nvh::loadFile("spv/raytrace.rchit.spv", true, defaultSearchPaths, true));
  stage.stage  = VK_SHADER_STAGE_CLOSEST_HIT_BIT_KHR;
  stages[eClosestHit] = stage;
~~~~ 

These identifiers are stored in the
`VkRayTracingShaderGroupCreateInfoKHR` structure. This structure first specifies a `type`, which represents the kind of
shader group represented in the structure. Ray generation and miss shaders are called 'general' shaders. In this case the
type is `VK_RAY_TRACING_SHADER_GROUP_TYPE_GENERAL_KHR`, and only the `generalShader` member of the structure is filled. The other ones are set to
`VK_SHADER_UNUSED_KHR`. This is also the case for the callable shaders, not used in this tutorial. In our layout the ray
generation comes first (0), followed by the miss shader (1).

~~~~ C
  // Shader groups
  VkRayTracingShaderGroupCreateInfoKHR group{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_RAY_TRACING_SHADER_GROUP_CREATE_INFO_KHR};
  group.anyHitShader       = VK_SHADER_UNUSED_KHR;
  group.closestHitShader   = VK_SHADER_UNUSED_KHR;
  group.generalShader      = VK_SHADER_UNUSED_KHR;
  group.intersectionShader = VK_SHADER_UNUSED_KHR;

  // Raygen
  group.type          = VK_RAY_TRACING_SHADER_GROUP_TYPE_GENERAL_KHR;
  group.generalShader = eRaygen;
  m_rtShaderGroups.push_back(group);

  // Miss
  group.type          = VK_RAY_TRACING_SHADER_GROUP_TYPE_GENERAL_KHR;
  group.generalShader = eMiss;
  m_rtShaderGroups.push_back(group);

~~~~

As detailed before, intersections are managed by 3 kinds of shaders: the intersection shader computes the ray-geometry
intersections, the any-hit shader is run for every potential intersection, and the closest hit shader is applied to the
closest hit point along the ray. Those 3 shaders are bound into a hit group. In our case the geometry is made of
triangles, so the `type` of the `VkRayTracingShaderGroupCreateInfoKHR` is `VK_RAY_TRACING_SHADER_GROUP_TYPE_TRIANGLES_HIT_GROUP_KHR`. 
We first reset the `generalShader` to `VK_SHADER_UNUSED_KHR`.
Raytrace hardware therefore takes
the place of the intersection shader, so, we leave the `intersectionShader` member to `VK_SHADER_UNUSED_KHR`. We do not use an any-hit
shader, letting the system use a built-in pass-through shader. Therefore, we also leave the `anyHitShader` to
`VK_SHADER_UNUSED_KHR`. The only shader we define is then the closest hit shader, by setting the `closestHitShader`
member to the index `2` (`chit`), since the `stages` vector already contains the ray generation and miss
shaders.

~~~~ C
// closest hit shader
group.type             = VK_RAY_TRACING_SHADER_GROUP_TYPE_TRIANGLES_HIT_GROUP_KHR;
group.generalShader    = VK_SHADER_UNUSED_KHR;
group.closestHitShader = eClosestHit;
m_rtShaderGroups.push_back(group);
~~~~

Note that if the geometry were not triangles, we would have set the `type` to `VK_RAY_TRACING_SHADER_GROUP_TYPE_PROCEDURAL_HIT_GROUP_KHR`, and would have to
define an intersection shader.

After creating the shader groups, we need to setup the pipeline layout that will describe how the pipeline
will access external data:

~~~~ C
  VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo pipelineLayoutCreateInfo;
~~~~

We first add the push constant range to allow the ray tracing shaders to access the global uniform values:  

~~~~ C
// Push constant: we want to be able to update constants used by the shaders
VkPushConstantRange pushConstant{VK_SHADER_STAGE_RAYGEN_BIT_KHR | VK_SHADER_STAGE_CLOSEST_HIT_BIT_KHR | VK_SHADER_STAGE_MISS_BIT_KHR,
                                 0, sizeof(PushConstantRay)};


VkPipelineLayoutCreateInfo pipelineLayoutCreateInfo{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_LAYOUT_CREATE_INFO};
pipelineLayoutCreateInfo.pushConstantRangeCount = 1;
pipelineLayoutCreateInfo.pPushConstantRanges    = &pushConstant;
~~~~

As described earlier, the pipeline uses two descriptor sets: `set=0` is specific to the ray tracing pipeline (TLAS and
output image), and `set=1` is shared with the rasterization (scene data):

~~~~ C
// Descriptor sets: one specific to ray tracing, and one shared with the rasterization pipeline
std::vector<VkDescriptorSetLayout> rtDescSetLayouts = {m_rtDescSetLayout, m_descSetLayout};
pipelineLayoutCreateInfo.setLayoutCount             = static_cast<uint32_t>(rtDescSetLayouts.size());
pipelineLayoutCreateInfo.pSetLayouts                = rtDescSetLayouts.data();
~~~~

The pipeline layout information is now complete, allowing us to create the layout itself.

~~~~ C  
vkCreatePipelineLayout(m_device, &pipelineLayoutCreateInfo, nullptr, &m_rtPipelineLayout);
~~~~

The creation of the ray tracing pipeline is different from the classical graphics pipeline. In the graphics pipeline we
simply need to fill in the fixed set of programmable stages (vertex, fragment, etc.). The ray tracing pipeline can
contain an arbitrary number of stages depending on the number of active shaders in the scene.

We first provide all the stages that will be used:

~~~~ C
// Assemble the shader stages and recursion depth info into the ray tracing pipeline
VkRayTracingPipelineCreateInfoKHR rayPipelineInfo{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_RAY_TRACING_PIPELINE_CREATE_INFO_KHR};
rayPipelineInfo.stageCount = static_cast<uint32_t>(stages.size());  // Stages are shaders
rayPipelineInfo.pStages    = stages.data();
~~~~

Then, we indicate how the shaders can be assembled into groups. A ray generation or miss shader is a group by
itself, but hit groups can comprise up to 3 shaders (intersection, any hit, closest hit).

~~~~ C
// In this case, m_rtShaderGroups.size() == 3: we have one raygen group,
// one miss shader group, and one hit group.
rayPipelineInfo.groupCount = static_cast<uint32_t>(m_rtShaderGroups.size());
rayPipelineInfo.pGroups    = m_rtShaderGroups.data();
~~~~

The ray generation and closest hit shaders can trace rays, making the ray tracing a potentially recursive process. To
allow the underlying RTX layer to optimize the pipeline we indicate the maximum recursion depth used by our shaders. For
the simplistic shaders we currently have, we set this depth to 1, meaning that we must not trigger
recursion at all (i.e. a hit shader calling `TraceRayEXT()`). Note that it is preferable to keep the recursion level
as low as possible, replacing it by a loop formulation instead.

~~~~ C
rayPipelineInfo.maxPipelineRayRecursionDepth = 1;  // Ray depth
rayPipelineInfo.layout                       = m_rtPipelineLayout;

vkCreateRayTracingPipelinesKHR(m_device, {}, {}, 1, &rayPipelineInfo, nullptr, &m_rtPipeline);
~~~~

Once the pipeline has been created we discard the shader modules:

~~~~ C
  for(auto& s : stages)
    vkDestroyShaderModule(m_device, s.module, nullptr);
}
~~~~

The pipeline layout and the pipeline itself also have to be cleaned up upon closing, hence we add this to
`destroyResources`:

~~~~ C
vkDestroyPipeline(m_device, m_rtPipeline, nullptr);
vkDestroyPipelineLayout(m_device, m_rtPipelineLayout, nullptr);
~~~~

## main

In the `main` function, we call the pipeline construction after the other ray tracing calls:

~~~~ C
  helloVk.createRtPipeline();
~~~~

# Shader Binding Table

In a typical rasterization setup, a current shader and its associated resources are bound prior to drawing the
corresponding objects, then another shader and resource set can be bound for some other objects, and so on. Since ray
tracing can hit any surface of the scene at any time, all shaders must be available simultaneously.

The Shader Binding Table is the "blueprint" of the ray tracing process. This allows us to select which ray generation shader
to use as the entry point, which miss shader to execute if no intersections are found, and which hit shader groups can be executed
for each instance. This association between instances and shader groups is created when setting up the geometry: for each
instance we provided a `hitGroupId` in the TLAS. This value is used to calculate the index in the SBT corresponding to the hit
group for that instance. The needed stride between entries is calculated from

* `PhysicalDeviceRayTracingPipelinePropertiesKHR::shaderGroupHandleSize`

* `PhysicalDeviceRayTracingPipelinePropertiesKHR::shaderGroupBaseAlignment`

* The size of any user-provided `shaderRecordEXT` data if used (in this case, no).

## Handles

The SBT is a collection of up to four arrays containing the handles of the shader groups used in the ray tracing pipeline, one array for each of the **ray generation**, **miss**, **hit** and **callable** (not used here) shader groups. In our example, we will create a buffer storing the arrays for the first three groups. Right now, we only have one shader of each type, so each "array" is just a handle to a group of shaders.

The buffer will have the following structure, which will be used later when calling `vkCmdTraceRaysKHR`:

![](Images/sbt_0.png)

We will ensure that all starting groups start with an address aligned to `shaderGroupBaseAlignment` and that each entry in the group is aligned to `shaderGroupHandleAlignment` bytes. 
All group entries are aligned with `shaderGroupHandleAlignment`. 

!!! Warning Size and Alignment Gotcha
    Pay close attention that the alignment corresponds to the handle or group size.
    There is no guarantee that the alignment corresponds to the handle or group size, so rounding up is necessary.
    Using `groupHandleSize` as the stride may coincidentally work on your hardware, but not all hardware.
    On hardware with a smaller handle size than alignment, it is possible to interleave some shaderRecordEXT data without additional memory usage.
    
    Round up sizes to the next alignment using the formula
    
    $alignedSize = [size + (alignment - 1)]\ \texttt{&}\ \texttt{~}(alignment - 1)$


!!! Note Special Case
    RayGen size and stride need to have the same value. 

We first add the declarations of the SBT creation method and the SBT buffer itself in the `HelloVulkan` class:

~~~~ C
void           createRtShaderBindingTable();

nvvk::Buffer                    m_rtSBTBuffer;
VkStridedDeviceAddressRegionKHR m_rgenRegion{};
VkStridedDeviceAddressRegionKHR m_missRegion{};
VkStridedDeviceAddressRegionKHR m_hitRegion{};
VkStridedDeviceAddressRegionKHR m_callRegion{};
~~~~

At the beginning of `createRtShaderBindingTable()` we collect information about the groups. There is always one and only one raygen, so we add the constant **1**.

~~~~ C
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The Shader Binding Table (SBT)
// - getting all shader handles and write them in a SBT buffer
// - Besides exception, this could be always done like this
//
void HelloVulkan::createRtShaderBindingTable()
{
  uint32_t missCount{1};
  uint32_t hitCount{1};
  auto     handleCount = 1 + missCount + hitCount;
  uint32_t handleSize  = m_rtProperties.shaderGroupHandleSize;
~~~~

The following sets the stride and size for each group. With the exception of RayGen, the stride will be the size of the handle aligned to the `shaderGroupHandleAlignment`. And the size of each group, is the number of elements in the group aligned to the `shaderGroupBaseAlignment`.

~~~~ C
// The SBT (buffer) need to have starting groups to be aligned and handles in the group to be aligned.
uint32_t handleSizeAligned = nvh::align_up(handleSize, m_rtProperties.shaderGroupHandleAlignment);

m_rgenRegion.stride = nvh::align_up(handleSizeAligned, m_rtProperties.shaderGroupBaseAlignment);
m_rgenRegion.size   = m_rgenRegion.stride;  // The size member of pRayGenShaderBindingTable must be equal to its stride member
m_missRegion.stride = handleSizeAligned;
m_missRegion.size   = nvh::align_up(missCount * handleSizeAligned, m_rtProperties.shaderGroupBaseAlignment);
m_hitRegion.stride  = handleSizeAligned;
m_hitRegion.size    = nvh::align_up(hitCount * handleSizeAligned, m_rtProperties.shaderGroupBaseAlignment);
~~~~

We then fetch the handles to the shader groups of the pipeline.

~~~~ C
// Get the shader group handles
uint32_t             dataSize = handleCount * handleSize;
std::vector<uint8_t> handles(dataSize);
auto result = vkGetRayTracingShaderGroupHandlesKHR(m_device, m_rtPipeline, 0, handleCount, dataSize, handles.data());
assert(result == VK_SUCCESS);
~~~~

The following will allocate the buffer that will hold the handle data. Note that the SBT buffer needs the `VK_BUFFER_USAGE_SHADER_BINDING_TABLE_BIT_KHR` flag. In order to trace rays we will also need the address of the SBT, which requires the `VK_BUFFER_USAGE_SHADER_DEVICE_ADDRESS_BIT` flag.

~~~~ C
// Allocate a buffer for storing the SBT.
VkDeviceSize sbtSize = m_rgenRegion.size + m_missRegion.size + m_hitRegion.size + m_callRegion.size;
m_rtSBTBuffer        = m_alloc.createBuffer(sbtSize,
                                     VK_BUFFER_USAGE_TRANSFER_SRC_BIT | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_SHADER_DEVICE_ADDRESS_BIT
                                         | VK_BUFFER_USAGE_SHADER_BINDING_TABLE_BIT_KHR,
                                     VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT | VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT);
m_debug.setObjectName(m_rtSBTBuffer.buffer, std::string("SBT"));  // Give it a debug name for NSight.
~~~~

In the next section, we store the device address of each shader group. Since we do not use callables, we leave it at 0.

~~~~ C
// Find the SBT addresses of each group
VkBufferDeviceAddressInfo info{VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_DEVICE_ADDRESS_INFO, nullptr, m_rtSBTBuffer.buffer};
VkDeviceAddress           sbtAddress = vkGetBufferDeviceAddress(m_device, &info);
m_rgenRegion.deviceAddress           = sbtAddress;
m_missRegion.deviceAddress           = sbtAddress + m_rgenRegion.size;
m_hitRegion.deviceAddress            = sbtAddress + m_rgenRegion.size + m_missRegion.size;
~~~~

This lambda function will return the pointer to the previously retrieved handle. We will use this function to copy the data from the handle into the SBT buffer.

~~~~ C
// Helper to retrieve the handle data
auto getHandle = [&] (int i) { return handles.data() + i * handleSize; };
~~~~

Since our buffer is visible to the host, we will map its memory in preparation for the data copy. 

~~~~ C
// Map the SBT buffer and write in the handles.
auto*    pSBTBuffer = reinterpret_cast<uint8_t*>(m_alloc.map(m_rtSBTBuffer));
uint8_t* pData{nullptr};
uint32_t handleIdx{0};
~~~~ 

Copy the RayGen handle. Only the handle data is copied, even if the stride and size are larger.

~~~~ C
// Raygen
pData = pSBTBuffer;
memcpy(pData, getHandle(handleIdx++), handleSize);
~~~~

Set the pointer to the beginning of the miss group and copy all the miss handles.
We only have one miss group for now, but this for-loop will work when we add more missed shaders. 

~~~~ C 
// Miss
pData = pSBTBuffer + m_rgenRegion.size;
for(uint32_t c = 0; c < missCount; c++)
{
  memcpy(pData, getHandle(handleIdx++), handleSize);
  pData += m_missRegion.stride;
}
~~~~

In the same way, copy the handles for the hit group.

~~~~ C
// Hit
pData = pSBTBuffer + m_rgenRegion.size + m_missRegion.size;
for(uint32_t c = 0; c < hitCount; c++)
{
  memcpy(pData, getHandle(handleIdx++), handleSize);
  pData += m_hitRegion.stride;
}
~~~~ 

Finalize and Clean up.

~~~~ C
  m_alloc.unmap(m_rtSBTBuffer);
  m_alloc.finalizeAndReleaseStaging();
}

~~~~

As with other resources, we destroy the SBT in `destroyResources`:

~~~~ C
  m_alloc.destroy(m_rtSBTBuffer);
~~~~



!!! Tip Shader order
    As with the pipeline, there is no requirement that raygen, miss, and hit groups come
    in this order. Since there's no reason to change the order, we constructed SBT entries
    0, 1, and 2 to correspond to entries 0, 1, and 2 of the `VkPipelineShaderStageCreateInfo`
    array used to build the pipeline. In general though, the order of the SBT need not match
    the pipeline shader stage order.

!!! Tip SBT Wrapper
    The number of entries per group can be retrieved from the `VkPhysicalDeviceRayTracingPipelinePropertiesKHR` that we used to create the ray tracing pipeline. The advantage of retrieving information from this structure, is that we don't have to follow a specific order. It goes beyond this tutorial, but we have a wrapper class that does all of the above automatically. You can find its implementation in 
    [`nnvk::SBTWrapper`](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/nvpro_core/tree/master/nvvk#sbtwrapper_vkhpp).
    Some of the extra samples will be using this class. 



## main

In the `main` function, we now add the construction of the Shader Binding Table:

~~~~ C
  helloVk.createRtShaderBindingTable();
~~~~

# Ray Tracing

Let's create a function that will record commands to call the ray trace shaders. First, add the declaration to the header

~~~~ C
void       raytrace(const VkCommandBuffer& cmdBuf, const nvmath::vec4f& clearColor);
~~~~

We first bind the pipeline and its layout, and set the push constants that will be available throughout the pipeline:

~~~~ C
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Ray Tracing the scene
//
void HelloVulkan::raytrace(const VkCommandBuffer& cmdBuf, const nvmath::vec4f& clearColor)
{
  m_debug.beginLabel(cmdBuf, "Ray trace");
  // Initializing push constant values
  m_pcRay.clearColor     = clearColor;
  m_pcRay.lightPosition  = m_pcRaster.lightPosition;
  m_pcRay.lightIntensity = m_pcRaster.lightIntensity;
  m_pcRay.lightType      = m_pcRaster.lightType;

  std::vector<VkDescriptorSet> descSets{m_rtDescSet, m_descSet};
  vkCmdBindPipeline(cmdBuf, VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_RAY_TRACING_KHR, m_rtPipeline);
  vkCmdBindDescriptorSets(cmdBuf, VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_RAY_TRACING_KHR, m_rtPipelineLayout, 0,
                          (uint32_t)descSets.size(), descSets.data(), 0, nullptr);
  vkCmdPushConstants(cmdBuf, m_rtPipelineLayout,
                     VK_SHADER_STAGE_RAYGEN_BIT_KHR | VK_SHADER_STAGE_CLOSEST_HIT_BIT_KHR | VK_SHADER_STAGE_MISS_BIT_KHR,
                     0, sizeof(PushConstantRay), &m_pcRay);
~~~~
  
Fortunately, all information about each `VkStridedDeviceAddressRegionKHR` was created in the `createRtShaderBindingTable()`.

We can finally call `traceRaysKHR` that will add the ray tracing launch in the command buffer. Note that the SBT buffer
address is mentioned several times. This is due to the possibility of separating the SBT into several buffers, one for each
type: ray generation, miss shaders, hit groups, and callable shaders (outside the scope of this tutorial). The last
three parameters are equivalent to the grid size of a compute launch, and represent the total number of threads. Since
we want to trace one ray per pixel, the grid size has the width and height of the output image, and a depth of 1.

~~~~ C  
  vkCmdTraceRaysKHR(cmdBuf, &m_rgenRegion, &m_missRegion, &m_hitRegion, &m_callRegion, m_size.width, m_size.height, 1);
  m_debug.endLabel(cmdBuf);
}
~~~~
!!! TIP Raygen shader selection
    If you built a pipeline with multiple raygen shaders, the raygen shader can be selected by changing the
    device address.

!!! TIP SBTWrapper 
    When using the SBTWrapper, the above could be replaced by folowing.
    ```
    auto& regions = m_stbWrapper.getRegions();
    vkCmdTraceRaysKHR(cmdBuf, &regions[0], &regions[1], &regions[2], &regions[3], size.width, size.height, 1);
    ```

# Let's Ray Trace

Now we have everything set up to be able to trace rays: the acceleration structure, the descriptor sets, the ray tracing
pipeline and the shader binding table. Let's try to make images from this.

## main

In the `main` function, we will define a local variable to switch between rasterization and ray tracing. Add the
following right after the ray tracing initialization calls:

~~~~ C
bool useRaytracer = true;
~~~~

In the same function, we will add a UI checkbox to make that switch at runtime. Right after the line
`ImGui::ColorEdit3(`, we add

~~~~ C
ImGui::Checkbox("Ray Tracer mode", &useRaytracer); // Switch between raster and ray tracing
~~~~

A few lines below, you can find a block containing the `helloVk.rasterize` call. Since our application will now have two
render modes, we replace that block by

~~~~ C
// Rendering Scene
if(useRaytracer)
{
  helloVk.raytrace(cmdBuf, clearColor);
}
else
{
  vkCmdBeginRenderPass(cmdBuf, &offscreenRenderPassBeginInfo, VK_SUBPASS_CONTENTS_INLINE);
  helloVk.rasterize(cmdBuf);
  vkCmdEndRenderPass(cmdBuf);
}
~~~~

Note that the ray tracing behaves more like a compute shader than a graphics task, and is then outside of a render pass.

We should now be able to alternate between rasterization and ray tracing. However, the ray tracing result only renders a
flat gray image: the simplistic ray generation shader does not trace any ray yet, and simply returns a fixed color.

# Camera Matrices

The matrices of the camera are stored in a uniform buffer and updated in the function `updateUniformBuffer`. 
This matrices are also needed for ray tracing, therefore we need to change the usage stage flag to include 
ray tracing. 

~~~~ C
auto     uboUsageStages = VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_VERTEX_SHADER_BIT | VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_RAY_TRACING_SHADER_BIT_KHR;
~~~~

## Ray generation (raytrace.rgen)

We need to include new files. Since the `#include` directive is a GLSL extension, we will add:

~~~~ C++
#extension GL_GOOGLE_include_directive : enable
~~~~

It is now time to enrich the ray generation shader to allow it to trace rays. We will first add a new binding to allow
the shader to access the camera matrices.

~~~~ C
#include "host_device.h"

layout(set = 1, binding = eGlobals) uniform _GlobalUniforms { GlobalUniforms uni; };
~~~~

!!! Note: Binding 
    The buffer of camera uses `binding = 0` as described in `host_device.h`. The 
    `set = 1` comes from the fact that it is the second descriptor set passed to
    `pipelineLayoutCreateInfo.pSetLayouts` in `HelloVulkan::createRtPipeline()`.

When tracing a ray, the hit or miss shaders need to be able to return some information to the shader program that
invoked the ray tracing. This is done through the use of a payload, identified by the `rayPayloadEXT` qualifier.

Since the payload struct will be reused in several shaders, we create a new shader file `raycommon.glsl` and add it to
the Visual Studio folder.

This file contains only the payload definition:

~~~~ C++
struct hitPayload
{
  vec3 hitValue;
};
~~~~

We now modify `raytrace.rgen` to include this new file.

~~~~ C++
#include "raycommon.glsl"
~~~~

The payload, identified with `rayPayloadEXT` is then our `hitPayload` structure.

~~~~ C
layout(location = 0) rayPayloadEXT hitPayload prd;
~~~~


The `main` function of the shader then starts by computing the floating-point pixel coordinates, normalized between 0
and 1. The `gl_LaunchIDEXT` contains the integer coordinates of the pixel being rendered, while `gl_LaunchSizeEXT`
corresponds to the image size provided when calling `traceRayEXT`.

~~~~ C
void main()
{
    const vec2 pixelCenter = vec2(gl_LaunchIDEXT.xy) + vec2(0.5);
    const vec2 inUV = pixelCenter/vec2(gl_LaunchSizeEXT.xy);
    vec2 d = inUV * 2.0 - 1.0;
~~~~

From the pixel coordinates, we can apply the inverse transformation of the view and projection matrices of the camera to
obtain the origin and direction of the ray.

~~~~ C
  vec4 origin    = uni.viewInverse * vec4(0, 0, 0, 1);
  vec4 target    = uni.projInverse * vec4(d.x, d.y, 1, 1);
  vec4 direction = uni.viewInverse * vec4(normalize(target.xyz), 0);
~~~~

In addition, we provide some flags for the ray: first. a flag indicating that all geometry will be considered opaque, as
we also indicated when creating the acceleration structures. We also indicate the minimum and maximum distance of the
potential intersections along the ray. Those distances can be useful to reduce the ray tracing costs if intersections
before or after a given point do not matter. A typical use case is for computing ambient occlusion.

~~~~ C
  uint  rayFlags = gl_RayFlagsOpaqueEXT;
  float tMin     = 0.001;
  float tMax     = 10000.0;
~~~~

We now trace the ray itself by calling `traceRayEXT`. This takes as arguments

* The top-level acceleration structure to search for hits in.

* The flags controlling the ray trace.

* An 8-bit "culling mask". Each instance used to build a TLAS includes an 8-bit mask. The instance mask is binary-AND-ed
  with the given culling mask and the intersection skipped if the AND result is 0. We aren't taking advantage of this,
  so we pass `0xFF` here, and the helper implicitly set each instance's mask to `0xFF` as well.

* `sbtRecordOffset` and `sbtRecordStride`, which controls how the
  `hitGroupId`
  (`VkAccelerationStructureInstanceKHR::instanceShaderBindingTableRecordOffset`)
  of each instance is used to look up a hit group in the SBT's hit
  group array. Since we only have one hit group, both are set to 0. The details of this are rather complicated; you can read more in [Will Usher's article](https://www.willusher.io/graphics/2019/11/20/the-sbt-three-ways).
<!-- Not sure why but Markdeep adds an extra bullet point if I split the above line -->

* `missIndex`, the index, within the miss shader group array of the SBT, of the shader to call if no intersection is found.

* The origin, min range, direction, and max range of the ray.

* The location of the payload as declared in this shader, in this case, `location=0`. This compile-time constant establishes
  the caller/callee relationship of `rayPayloadInEXT`, allowing you to choose where you want the called shader outputs to go.
  For shaders (callees) invoked as a direct result of this `traceRayEXT`, their `rayPayloadInEXT` variable will
  **alias** the `rayPayloadEXT` of the location specified by the caller of `traceRayEXT`. For this to work properly, both
  variables should have the same structure. This allows us to determine at runtime where callee shader outputs are written to,
  which can be particularly useful for recursive ray tracers.
  

~~~~ C  
  traceRayEXT(topLevelAS, // acceleration structure
          rayFlags,       // rayFlags
          0xFF,           // cullMask
          0,              // sbtRecordOffset
          0,              // sbtRecordStride
          0,              // missIndex
          origin.xyz,     // ray origin
          tMin,           // ray min range
          direction.xyz,  // ray direction
          tMax,           // ray max range
          0               // payload (location = 0)
  );
~~~~

Finally, we write the resulting payload into the output image.

~~~~ C
    imageStore(image, ivec2(gl_LaunchIDEXT.xy), vec4(prd.hitValue, 1.0));
}
~~~~

Raster                         |     | Ray Trace
:-----------------------------:|:---:|:--------------------------------:
![](Images/resultRasterCube.png width="350px")   | <-> |   ![](Images/resultRaytraceFlatCube.png width="350px")

!!!NOTE `rayPayloadEXT` locations
    The `location` qualifiers are used to give payloads a unique identifier
    for `traceRayEXT`. For some reason, you cannot just pass payloads by-name to
    `traceRayEXT` (this was deemed un-GLSL-y).
    
    The scope of the `location` is just within one invocation of one shader. Hence,
    
    * If two different shader modules linked into the same ray trace pipeline
      declare a payload with the same `location` number, these payloads do not interfere
      with each other.
    
    * If a shader is invoked recursively, each invocation's payloads are separate,
      even though their `location` numbers are the same. This is the reason ray
      trace shaders require a GPU stack, a rather novel concept for computer graphics.

    Note how payload `location`s are different from things like descriptor `set`s
    and `binding`s, or vertex attribute `location`s, whose scope is global to the
    entire pipeline.

!!!NOTE `rayPayloadInEXT` locations
    The `rayPayloadInEXT` variable has a `location` as well because it can also be
    passed as the payload for `traceRayEXT`. In this case, the calling shader's
    incoming payload itself becomes the incoming payload for the callee shader.
    
    Note that there is no requirement that the `location` of the callee's incoming
    payload match the `payload` argument the caller passed to `traceRayEXT`! This
    is quite unlike the `in`/`out` variables used to connect vertex shaders and
    fragment shaders.

## Miss shader (raytrace.miss)

To share the clear color of the rasterization with the ray tracer, we will change the return value of the miss shader to
return the clear value passed as a push constant. While the `Constants` struct contains more members, here we use the
fact that `clearColor` is the first member in the struct, and do not even declare the subsequent members.

~~~~ C
#extension GL_GOOGLE_include_directive : enable
#extension GL_EXT_shader_explicit_arithmetic_types_int64 : require

#include "raycommon.glsl"
#include "wavefront.glsl"

layout(location = 0) rayPayloadInEXT hitPayload prd;

layout(push_constant) uniform _PushConstantRay
{
  PushConstantRay pcRay;
};

void main()
{
  prd.hitValue = pcRay.clearColor.xyz * 0.8;
}
~~~~

!!! Note:
    The color of the background is slightly darker to differentiate the two renderers.



# Simple Lighting

The current closest hit shader only returns a flat color. To add some lighting, we will need to introduce the concept of
surface normals. However, the ray tracing only provides the barycentric coordinates of the hit point. To obtain the
normals and the other vertex attributes, we will need to find them in the vertex buffer and interpolate them using the
barycentric coordinates. This is why we extended the usage of the vertex and index buffers when creating the ray tracing
descriptor set.

## Closest Hit (raytrace.rchit)

When we created the ray tracing descriptor set, we already included the geometry definition. Therefore, we can reference
the vertex and index buffers directly in the closest hit shader, via the scene description `binding = 2`

We first include the payload definition and the OBJ-Wavefront structures

~~~~ C
#extension GL_EXT_scalar_block_layout : enable
#extension GL_GOOGLE_include_directive : enable
#extension GL_EXT_shader_explicit_arithmetic_types_int64 : require
#extension GL_EXT_buffer_reference2 : require
#include "raycommon.glsl"
#include "wavefront.glsl"
~~~~

Then we describe the resources according to the descriptor set layout

~~~~ C
layout(location = 0) rayPayloadInEXT hitPayload prd;

layout(buffer_reference, scalar) buffer Vertices {Vertex v[]; }; // Positions of an object
layout(buffer_reference, scalar) buffer Indices {ivec3 i[]; }; // Triangle indices
layout(buffer_reference, scalar) buffer Materials {WaveFrontMaterial m[]; }; // Array of all materials on an object
layout(buffer_reference, scalar) buffer MatIndices {int i[]; }; // Material ID for each triangle
layout(set = 1, binding = eObjDescs, scalar) buffer ObjDesc_ { ObjDesc i[]; } objDesc;

layout(push_constant) uniform _PushConstantRay { PushConstantRay pcRay; };
~~~~

In the `main` function, the `gl_InstanceCustomIndexEXT` tells which object was hit, and the `gl_PrimitiveID` allows us to find the vertices of the triangle hit by the ray:

~~~~ C
void main()
{
    // Object data
    ObjDesc    objResource = objDesc.i[gl_InstanceCustomIndexEXT];
    MatIndices matIndices  = MatIndices(objResource.materialIndexAddress);
    Materials  materials   = Materials(objResource.materialAddress);
    Indices    indices     = Indices(objResource.indexAddress);
    Vertices   vertices    = Vertices(objResource.vertexAddress);
  
    // Indices of the triangle
    ivec3 ind = indices.i[gl_PrimitiveID];
  
    // Vertex of the triangle
    Vertex v0 = vertices.v[ind.x];
    Vertex v1 = vertices.v[ind.y];
    Vertex v2 = vertices.v[ind.z];
~~~~

Computing the barycentric coordinates is done the following way
~~~~ C
  const vec3 barycentrics = vec3(1.0 - attribs.x - attribs.y, attribs.x, attribs.y);
~~~~

The world-space position could be calculated in two ways, the first one being to use the information from the hit
shader. But this could have precision issues if the hit point is very far.

~~~~ C
  vec3 worldPos = gl_WorldRayOriginEXT + gl_WorldRayDirectionEXT * gl_HitTEXT;
~~~~

Another solution, more precise, consists in computing the position by interpolation. 
We are using the state materices provided on the hit. Those matrices are compute 
using the information provided we we set the TLAS and BLAS. Note that all our BLASes
didn't apply any transformation, only the instances.

~~~~ C
// Computing the coordinates of the hit position
const vec3 pos      = v0.pos * barycentrics.x + v1.pos * barycentrics.y + v2.pos * barycentrics.z;
const vec3 worldPos = vec3(gl_ObjectToWorldEXT * vec4(pos, 1.0));  // Transforming the position to world space
~~~~

We can do the same thing for the normal

~~~~C
// Computing the normal at hit position
const vec3 nrm      = v0.nrm * barycentrics.x + v1.nrm * barycentrics.y + v2.nrm * barycentrics.z;
const vec3 worldNrm = normalize(vec3(nrm * gl_WorldToObjectEXT));  // Transforming the normal to world space
~~~~

The light source specified in the constants can then be used to compute the dot product of the normal with the lighting
direction, giving a simple diffuse lighting effect:

~~~~ C
  // Vector toward the light
  vec3  L;
  float lightIntensity = pcRay.lightIntensity;
  float lightDistance  = 100000.0;
  // Point light
  if(pcRay.lightType == 0)
  {
    vec3 lDir      = pcRay.lightPosition - worldPos;
    lightDistance  = length(lDir);
    lightIntensity = pcRay.lightIntensity / (lightDistance * lightDistance);
    L              = normalize(lDir);
  }
  else  // Directional light
  {
    L = normalize(pcRay.lightPosition);
  }
~~~~

![](Images/resultRaytraceLightGreyCube.png width="350px") 


# Simple Materials

The rendering above could be made more interesting by adding support for materials. The imported OBJ objects provide
simplified Alias Wavefront material definitions.

## raytrace.rchit

These materials define their basic reflectance properties using simple color coefficients, and also support texturing.
The buffer containing the materials has already been created for rasterization, and has also been added into the ray
tracing descriptor set. Add the binding of the array of texture samplers:

~~~~ C
layout(set = 1, binding = eTextures) uniform sampler2D textureSamplers[];
~~~~

The declaration of the material is the same as that used for the rasterizer and is defined in
`wavefront.glsl`.

The `Vertex` structure contains a material index, which we will use to find the corresponding material in the buffer.

We first remove these lines at the end of `main()`

~~~~ C
float dotNL = max(dot(normal, L), 0.2);
prd.hitValue = vec3(dotNL);
~~~~

and fetch the material definition instead:

~~~~ C
  // Material of the object
  int               matIdx = matIndices.i[gl_PrimitiveID];
  WaveFrontMaterial mat    = materials.m[matIdx];
~~~~

!!! Note Note
    There is one buffer of materials per object, and each material can be access via the index. 
    And each triangle has an index of material.

From that material definition, we use the diffuse and specular reflectances to compute diffuse lighting. This code also
supports textures to modulate the surface albedo.

~~~~ C
  // Diffuse
  vec3 diffuse = computeDiffuse(mat, L, normal);
  if(mat.textureId >= 0)
  {
    uint txtId = mat.textureId + scnDesc.i[gl_InstanceCustomIndexEXT].txtOffset;
    vec2 texCoord =
        v0.texCoord * barycentrics.x + v1.texCoord * barycentrics.y + v2.texCoord * barycentrics.z;
    diffuse *= texture(textureSamplers[nonuniformEXT(txtId)], texCoord).xyz;
  }
  
  // Specular
  vec3 specular = computeSpecular(mat, gl_WorldRayDirectionEXT, L, normal);
~~~~

The final lighting is then computed as

~~~~ C
  prd.hitValue = vec3(lightIntensity * (diffuse + specular));
~~~~

![](Images/resultRaytraceLightMatCube.png width="350px") 


## main

The OBJ model is loaded in `main.cpp` by calling `helloVk.loadModel`. Let's load something more interesting than a cube:

~~~~ C
  // Creation of the example
  helloVk.loadModel(nvh::findFile("media/scenes/Medieval_building.obj", defaultSearchPaths, true));
  helloVk.loadModel(nvh::findFile("media/scenes/plane.obj", defaultSearchPaths, true));
~~~~

Since that model is larger, we can change the `CameraManip.setLookat` call to

~~~~ C
CameraManip.setLookat(nvmath::vec3f(4, 4, 4), nvmath::vec3f(0, 1, 0), nvmath::vec3f(0, 1, 0));
~~~~

![](Images/resultRaytraceLightMatMedieval.png)

# Shadows

The above allows us to ray trace a scene and apply some lighting, but it is still missing shadows. To this end, we will
add a new ray type, and shoot rays from the closest hit shader. This new ray type will require adding a new miss shader.

## `createRaytracingPipeline`

For simple shadow rays we only need to compute whether some geometry was hit along the ray or not. This can be achieved
using a Boolean payload initialized as if a hit were found, and ray trace using only an additional miss shader that will
set the payload to no hit.

!!! Warning: [Download Shadow Shader](files/shadowShaders.zip)
    Download and add shader file

This archive contains only one file, `raytraceShadow.rmiss`. Add this file to the `src/shaders` directory and rerun
CMake. The shader file should compile, and the resulting SPIR-V file should be stored in the `shaders` folder alongside
the GLSL file.

In the body of `createRtPipeline`, we need to define the new miss shader right after the previous miss shader:

~~~~ C
enum StageIndices
{
  eRaygen,
  eMiss,
  eMiss2,
  eClosestHit,
  eShaderGroupCount 
};
~~~~ 

And create the stage

~~~~ C
// The second miss shader is invoked when a shadow ray misses the geometry. It simply indicates that no occlusion has been found
stage.module =
    nvvk::createShaderModule(m_device, nvh::loadFile("spv/raytraceShadow.rmiss.spv", true, defaultSearchPaths, true));
stage.stage   = VK_SHADER_STAGE_MISS_BIT_KHR;
stages[eMiss2] = stage;
~~~~

After pushing the miss shader `missSM`, we also push the miss shader for the shadow rays:

~~~~ C
// Shadow Miss
group.type          = VK_RAY_TRACING_SHADER_GROUP_TYPE_GENERAL_KHR;
group.generalShader = eMiss2;
m_rtShaderGroups.push_back(group);
~~~~

The pipeline now has to allow shooting rays from the closest hit program, which requires increasing the recursion level to 2:

~~~~ C
  // The ray tracing process can shoot rays from the camera, and a shadow ray can be shot from the
  // hit points of the camera rays, hence a recursion level of 2. This number should be kept as low
  // as possible for performance reasons. Even recursive ray tracing should be flattened into a loop
  // in the ray generation to avoid deep recursion.
  rayPipelineInfo.maxPipelineRayRecursionDepth = 2;  // Ray depth
~~~~


!!! WARNING Recursion Limit
    The spec does not guarantee a recursion check at runtime. If you exceed either
    the recursion depth you reported in the raytrace pipeline create info, or the
    physical device recursion limit, undefined behavior results.
    
    The KHR raytracing spec lowers the minimum guaranteed recursion limit from
    31 (in the original NV spec) to the much more modest limit of 1 (i.e. no
    recursion at all). Since we now need a recursion limit of 2, we should check
    that the device supports the needed level of recursion:
    
    ~~~~ C
      // Spec only guarantees 1 level of "recursion". Check for that sad possibility here.
      if (m_rtProperties.maxRayRecursionDepth <= 1) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Device fails to support ray recursion (m_rtProperties.maxRayRecursionDepth <= 1)");
      }
    ~~~~
    
    Recall that `m_rtProperties` was filled in in `HelloVulkan::initRayTracing`.

## `createRtShaderBindingTable`

The addition of the new miss shader group has modified our shader binding table, which now looks like:

![](Images/sbt_1.png)

Therefore, we have to change `HelloVulkan::createRtShaderBindingTable` to indicate that there are two miss shaders. 

~~~~ C
uint32_t missCount{2};
~~~~

## `createRtDescriptorSet`

For each resource entry in the descriptor set, we indicated which shader stage would be able to use it. Since shadow
rays will be traced from the closest hit shader, we add `VK_SHADER_STAGE_CLOSEST_HIT_BIT_KHR` to the acceleration structure binding:

~~~~ C
  // Top-level acceleration structure, usable by both the ray generation and the closest hit (to shoot shadow rays)
  m_rtDescSetLayoutBind.addBinding(RtxBindings::eTlas, VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_KHR, 1,
                                   VK_SHADER_STAGE_RAYGEN_BIT_KHR | VK_SHADER_STAGE_CLOSEST_HIT_BIT_KHR);  // TLAS
~~~~

## `raytrace.rchit`

The closest hit shader now needs to be aware of the acceleration structure to be able to shoot rays:

~~~~ C
layout(set = 0, binding = eTlas) uniform accelerationStructureEXT topLevelAS;
~~~~

Those rays will also carry a payload, which will need to be defined at a different location from the payload of the
current ray. In this case, the payload will be a simple Boolean value indicating whether an occluder has been found or
not:

~~~~ C
layout(location = 1) rayPayloadEXT bool isShadowed;
~~~~

In the `main` function, instead of simply setting our payload to `prd.hitValue = c;`, we will initiate a new ray. 
To select the shadow miss shader, we will pass `missIndex=1` instead of `0` to `traceRayEXT()`. The payload location
is defined to match  the declaration `layout(location = 1)` above. Note, when invoking `traceRayEXT()`  we are setting 
the flags with 

* `gl_RayFlagsSkipClosestHitShaderKHR`: Will not invoke the hit shader, only the miss shader
* `gl_RayFlagsOpaqueKHR` : Will not call the any hit shader, so all objects will be opaque
* `gl_RayFlagsTerminateOnFirstHitKHR` : The first hit is always good.

Since we skip the shadow hit group, no code will be invoked when hitting a surface. Therefore, we initialize the payload
`isShadowed` to `true`, and will rely on the miss shader to set it to false if no surfaces have been encountered. We
also set the ray flags to optimize the ray tracing: since these simple shadow rays only need to return whether the ray
intersects any surface, we can instruct the ray tracing engine to stop the traversal after finding the first
intersection, without trying to execute a closest hit shader.

Shadow rays only need to be cast if the light is in front of the surface, and specular lighting should not be computed
if we are in shadow (since the light source won't be visible from the shading point). The code that previously computed
the specular term will then look like this:

~~~~ C
  vec3  specular    = vec3(0);
  float attenuation = 1;

  // Tracing shadow ray only if the light is visible from the surface

    if(isShadowed)
    {
      attenuation = 0.3;
    }
    else
    {
      // Specular
      specular = computeSpecular(mat, gl_WorldRayDirectionEXT, L, normal);
    }
  }

The final payload value can then be adjusted depending on the result of the shadow ray:

~~~~ C
prd.hitValue = vec3(lightIntensity * attenuation * (diffuse + specular));

The final project can be found under the [ray_tracing__simple](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_raytracing_tutorial_KHR/tree/master/ray_tracing__simple) directory.


# Going Further

From this point on, you can continue creating your own ray types and shaders, and experiment 
with more advanced ray tracing based algorithms.
