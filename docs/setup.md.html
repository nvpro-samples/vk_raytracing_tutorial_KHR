# Environment Setup

To get support for `VK_NV_ray_tracing`, please install an [NVIDIA driver](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us)
with version 440.97 or later, and the [Vulkan SDK](http://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home) version 1.1.126.0 or later.

This tutorial is a modification of [`ray_tracing__simple`](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_raytracing_tutorial/tree/master/ray_tracing__simple), which is the result of the ray tracing tutorial. 
All following instructions are based on the modification of this project.

Besides the current repository, you will also need to clone or download the following repositories:

* [shared_sources](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/shared_sources): The primary framework that all samples depend on.
* [shared_external](https://github.com/nvpro-samples/shared_external): Third party libraries that are provided pre-compiled, mostly for Windows x64 / MSVC.

The directory structure should be looking like:

**********************************************************
*   \ 
*   |
*   +-- 📂 shared_external
*   |
*   +-- 📂 shared_sources
*   |

*   |   |
*   |   +-- 📂 ray_tracing__simple (<-- Start here)
*   |   |

*   |   ⋮
